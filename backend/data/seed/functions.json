Complete error codes with FMI numbers (like \"Error 3818 FMI:1\") - THESE ARE CRITICAL\n2. System components (sensors, valves, modules, controllers)\n3. Environmental conditions when the fault occurred (temperature, weather)\n\nNEVER leave the vehicle make and model fields empty if they appear in the message.\nIf you see \"MAN TGL 12.250\" you MUST extract make=\"MAN\" and model=\"TGL 12.250\".\n\nAlways provide a clear, descriptive title that includes the make, model and primary issue (e.g., \"MAN TGL 12.250 - Exhaust Back Pressure Valve Repair\").\n\nFocus on creating a technically accurate and useful repair guide that a mechanic could follow to fix the same issue.",
